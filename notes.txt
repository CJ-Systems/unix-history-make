Goal: Consolidate data concerning the evolution of a Unix system
in a form that helps the study of the system's evolution,
by entering them into a revision repository.

See
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg/2000px-Unix_history-simple.svg.png
Research-Development-*
	Contains the files from the releases committed at their
	last modification date.
	This is merged after each release on the date of the newest file
	in a specific release.
Research-Release
	Contains a complete snapshot of each release by merging complete
	development and (possibly) SCCS branches.
	Tagged with the name of the release

BSD-Development
	The parent is Research-Release v7
	As above
BSD-SCCS
	A recursive import of the SCCS repos
	According to https://github.com/weiss/original-bsd/blob/master/README
	"The project began using a source code control system (SCCS) in 1980 
	three years after Bill Joy began his initial Berkeley UNIX
	development)."
	Given that 3BSD was released at the end of 1979, it seems logical to
	import SCCS commits on top of BSD3
	The SCCS logs are available on CD-ROM from:
	https://www.mckusick.com/csrg/

Unix32V
	http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/VAX/Distributions/32V/
	Parent is the Seventh Edition

BSD-Release
	As above
	In addition each release's commit is marked as a merge with the
	SCCS branch at the timepoint of its creation.

	http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/
		1bsd (parent is the sixth edition)
		2bsd
	http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/4BSD/Distributions/
		3bsd (parents are 2bsd and Unix32V)
		4.0 (from McKusick's CD-ROM 1)
		4.1 (from McKusick's CD-ROM 1)
		...
		4.2BSD
		4.3BSD
		4.3BSD-Tahoe
		4.3BSD-Reno
		Net2

386BSD
	http://www.oldlinux.org/Linux.old/distributions/386BSD/386bsd-0.0/
	( March 1992)
	http://www.oldlinux.org/Linux.old/distributions/386BSD/0.1/
	( July 14, 1992)

FreeBSD
	A pull from the FreeBSD git conversion site
	FreeBSD commits start on Sat Jun 12 14:49:13 1993 UTC
	http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=2
	This is before  late 1994 when the finished version of
	386BSD Release 1.0 was distributed.

	After FreeBSD 2.2.x pull in BSD 4.4 lite2

Lessons learned {{{1
Split responsibilities between kernel and device drivers
Ability to follow file moves by keeping a lookaside copy of preceding snapshot

New strategy {{{1
First commit:
rename old top directories to previous_version/...

Last commit
Remove previous_version
TODO {{{1
